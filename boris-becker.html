He became both ATP and ITF's Player of the Year in 1989. After his successful career ended, Becker has engaged in numerous ventures, such as working in the field of poker.</p><p>At the peak of his career, Becker had amassed a reported <strong>$63 million</strong>. However, on <i>June 21, 2017,</i> he was declared bankrupt, and in <i>2019,</i> he was forced to auction off 82 collectibles from his personal collection. Boris makes headlines for his notorious personal life and has been in a relationship with many women. However, he has been married twice and has four children.</p><h2>Boris Becker's First Wife</h2><p>The German Ace, Becker 's first spouse, was <strong>Barbara Feltus Becker</strong>, a German-American designer, former actress, and model. Boris and Barbara met in the fall of 1991 and began a romantic affair. Their wedding ceremony was held on <i>December 17, 1993,</i> at the registry office of Becker's hometown of Leimen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/24/Boris_and_Barbara-1571896950249.jpg><p>Before the marriage, the former couple shocked the German fans and sports enthusiasts by posing nude for the cover of a weekly news magazine, <i>'Stern'</i> in a picture taken by Barbara's father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/24/Becker_children-1571897037449.jpg><p>At the time of their marriage, Barbara was eight months pregnant with Becker's child. Their first son <strong>Noah Gabriel</strong> was born on <i>January 18, 1994,</i> and their second son, <strong>Elias Balthasar,</strong> was born on <i>September 4, 1999</i>.</p><h2>Reason Behind Boris and Barbara's Divorce</h2><p>After seven years of marriage, Becker asked Barbara for separation in <i>December 2000, </i>and he was granted a divorce on <i>January 15, 2001</i>. Barbara left for Florida after a woman who claimed to be pregnant with Becker's child contacted her.</p><p>Further, Becker stated in his autobiography that he admitted to his wife about having a one night stand while Barbara was pregnant with their second child. Following the divorce, Barbara received a <strong>$14.4 million</strong> settlement, their condo on Florida, and custody of their children.</p><h2>Second Wife-Lilly Becker</h2><p>In <i>February 2009,</i> Boris announced on a television show that he and <a href=#><strong>Sharlely "Lilly" Kerssenberg</strong></a> were to be married. The wedding took place on <i>June 12, 2009,</i> in St Moritz, Switzerland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/24/Boris_and_Lilly-1571897253359.jpg><p>How did they meet? Lilly is a Dutch model, and she met Boris during the separation phase of her first marriage with lawyer and entrepreneur, <strong>Michael R. Bermann</strong>. At the time, Boris had a birthday party with his son on <i>September 4, 2005,</i> in a pizzeria in Miami Beach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/24/BorisLillykid-1571897378140.jpg><p>The former couple has a son named <strong>Amadeus Benedict Edley Luis Becker,</strong> born on <i>February 9, 2010</i>. Unfortunately, Boris and Lilly separated after nine years of marriage in <i>May 2018</i>.</p><h2>Boris Is Dating A Super Hot Model</h2><p>Around mid-2019, reports suggested that Boris began dating a British model, <strong>Layla Powell</strong>. They made their first public appearance together on South London for the annual Wimbledon Championships in <i>July 2019</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/24/Boris_and_Layla%20(1)-1571897665171.jpg><p>Layla, who is twenty years younger than Boris, had known him for several years.

Before marrying Barbara, Boris was in a relationship with <strong>Benedicte Courtin</strong>, the daughter of the Chief of Police of Monaco.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/24/Boris_and_Angela-1571897971254.jpg><p>In <i>February 2001,</i> Becker accepted the paternity of a daughter, <strong>Anna Ermakova, </strong>with Russian waitress <strong>Angela Ermakova</strong>. He took the step after the media reported that he had a child after having a sexual encounter in <i>1999</i>. Further, Becker was engaged to <strong>Alessandra Meyer-Wolden</strong> in <i>2008</i> for a short time.</p><h2>Net Worth-$10 Million</h2><p>The former World No.1 tennis player, Boris Becker, has a net worth of <strong>$10 million</strong> as of 2019.
