She is just in her mid teenage so it is too early to talk about the romantic relationship. Thus, she might be focusing on her studies or spending quality time with her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/27/8a4d0b16871cc5ac316b98539256a59d-1587960352789.jpg><p>&nbsp;Delilah, meanwhile, stays away from the spotlight or media.</p><h2>Parents Were Together for 17 Years</h2><p>On the other hand, her mother and dad cherished each other's most intimate moments of their lives. They met in 2001 through a common friend. They fell in love shortly and began dating each other.</p><p>Laurence and Gina later announced their engagement in February 2001 and married on 22 September 2002. The wedding ceremony was taken at The Cloisters Museum in New York City in the presence of their parents and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/27/Laurence-Fishburne-Wife-Marriage-Wedding-Gina-Torres-1587960111413.jpg><p>Fishburne's spokesman Alan Nierob revealed after five years of marriage on January 8, 2007, that they were expecting their first child together who was Delilah. Things went sour between them, however, and it was reported on September 20, 2017, that they were separated on September 20, 2017.</p><p>The actor Fishburne subsequently filed for divorce on 2 November 2017.
