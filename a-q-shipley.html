He is an American by nationality and has a white ethnical background.</p><p>He stood as a multi-sport athlete in his early childhood, playing baseball, basketball, and football.</p><p>Whereas his Father stood as a golf fan cum player, and golf just made a way to connect.</p><p>Allan, his Father, worked at a chemical plant factory in Houston and had to reside separately from his kids and wife.</p><p>That’s different; he made time for his family and visited his house on weekends in Pennsylvania.</p><p>He would hatch at least four hours, and Allan and AQ made rounds together and shared quality time, which is almost a requirement in a father-son relationship.</p><p>His Father taught Shipley the fundamental rules and definition of hard work. He wanted his son to learn the sport’s etiquette so hard that it would bring significant discipline to his life.</p><p>On the other hand, even AQ embraced all those teaching, preachings, and lessons rendered by his Father. He was eloquent at learning.</p><h2>AQ Shipley | High School Career</h2><p>He attended Moon Area High School in Moon Township, Pennsylvania.
